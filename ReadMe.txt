hi !
you need to have this modules installed on your interperter :


termcolor 2
socket io
tabulate
json
pyfiglet


Be sure to run server first

-----------

note : you must sign up first to start playing , usernames and passwords are be saved in user_pass.txt

two defualt accounts are created for testing . first part is username , second is password and third is users color .

dont use space in your username and password

some colors may not work ! but I collect them from termcolor2 doc in this link : https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/

have a good time and enjoy playing quarto
